| Crime Detection    | Accident Detection                   | Road accidents in India are a major cause of decreasing life expectancy. These accidents occur due to violation of traffic safety rules, careless rash driving, driver drowsiness and lack of good quality roads. The problem becomes more adverse for highways and hilly areas where accidents are unavoidable. Road accidents are characterized by high death rates due to delay in arrival of help and inefficient systems of mitigation to alert the concerned authorities. The task is to identify accidents and send an alert to respective authorities. |  https://webpages.uncc.edu/cchen62/dataset.html   |

|                    | Violence Detection                   | Today, the amount of public violence has increased dramatically. This has resulted in the ubiquitous use of surveillance cameras. This has helped the authorities to identify these events and take the necessary measures. But almost all systems today require the human-inspection of these videos to identify such events, which is virtually inefficient. Therefore we want to have such a practical system that can automatically monitor and identify the surveillance videos.                                                                          | http://visilab.etsii.uclm.es/personas/oscar/FightDetection/Peliculas.rar http://visilab.etsii.uclm.es/personas/oscar/FightDetection/HockeyFights.zip  https://webpages.uncc.edu/cchen62/dataset.html |
